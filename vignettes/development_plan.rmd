# Summary

This is a document that outlines technical notes and the development plan for implementing survival models
and meta-analyzing hazard ratios in the DataSHIELD platform.

# Survival analysis in DataSHIELD

We outline the development and code for implementing survival models and meta-analysis
of hazard ratios in DataSHIELD.

All code is available here:

   * https://github.com/neelsoumya/dsBaseClient/tree/absolute_newbie_client
   
   * https://github.com/neelsoumya/dsBase/tree/absolute_newbie
   
   * https://github.com/neelsoumya/datashield_testing_basic/blob/master/development_plan.rmd
   
   * https://github.com/neelsoumya/datashield_testing_basic/blob/master/development_plan.pdf
   

The computational steps are outlined below. 
The first step is connecting to the server and loading the survival data.
We assume that the reader is familiar with these details.

# Creating server-side variables for survival analysis

We now outline some steps for analysing survival data.

* make sure that the outcome variable is numeric 

```
ds.asNumeric(x.name = "D$cens",
             newobj = "EVENT",
             datasources = connections)

ds.asNumeric(x.name = "D$survtime",
             newobj = "SURVTIME",
             datasources = connections)
```

*  convert time id variable to a factor 

```

ds.asFactor(input.var.name = "D$time.id",
            newobj = "TID",
            datasources = connections)

```

*  create in the server-side the log(survtime) variable

```

ds.log(x = "D$survtime",
       newobj = "log.surv",
       datasources = connections)

```

*  create start time variable

```

ds.asNumeric(x.name = "D$starttime",
             newobj = "STARTTIME",
             datasources = connections)

ds.asNumeric(x.name = "D$endtime",
             newobj = "ENDTIME",
             datasources = connections)

```



```{r, include=FALSE}

# make sure that the outcome is numeric 
ds.asNumeric(x.name = "D$cens",
             newobj = "EVENT",
             datasources = connections)

ds.asNumeric(x.name = "D$survtime",
             newobj = "SURVTIME",
             datasources = connections)

# convert time id variable to a factor 
ds.asFactor(input.var.name = "D$time.id",
            newobj = "TID",
            datasources = connections)

# create in the server-side the log(survtime) variable
ds.log(x = "D$survtime",
       newobj = "log.surv",
       datasources = connections)

# create start time variable
ds.asNumeric(x.name = "D$starttime",
             newobj = "STARTTIME",
             datasources = connections)

# create end time variable
ds.asNumeric(x.name = "D$endtime",
             newobj = "ENDTIME",
             datasources = connections)


# check which variables exist
dsBaseClient::ds.ls()

# call new function modify NAMESPACE and DESCRIPTION
# call coxph server side
# client side function is here:
# https://github.com/neelsoumya/dsBaseClient/blob/absolute_newbie_client/R/ds.coxph.SLMA.R
# server side function is here:
# https://github.com/neelsoumya/dsBase/blob/absolute_newbie/R/coxphSLMADS.R
```


# Create survival object and call coxphSLMA()


* use constructed Surv object in *coxph.SLMA()*

```
dsBaseClient::ds.Surv(time='STARTTIME', time2='ENDTIME', 
                      event = 'EVENT', objectname='surv_object',
                      type='counting')

coxph_model_full <- dsBaseClient::ds.coxph.SLMA(formula = 'surv_object~D$age+D$female')

```

* use direct inline call to *survival::Surv()*

```

ds.coxph.SLMA(formula = 'survival::Surv(time=SURVTIME,event=EVENT)~D$age+D$female', 
                dataName = 'D', 
                datasources = connections)

```

* call with *survival::strata()*

```

coxph_model_strata <- dsBaseClient::ds.coxph.SLMA(formula = 'surv_object~D$age + 
                          survival::strata(D$female)')

summary(coxph_model_strata)

```


```{r, include=FALSE}

# 1. use constructed surv object in coxph
dsBaseClient::ds.Surv(time='STARTTIME', time2='ENDTIME', event = 'EVENT', objectname='surv_object', type='counting')
coxph_model_full <- dsBaseClient::ds.coxph.SLMA(formula = 'surv_object~D$age+D$female')

# 2. use direct inline call
ds.coxph.SLMA(formula = 'survival::Surv(time=SURVTIME,event=EVENT)~D$age+D$female', dataName = 'D', datasources = connections)

# 3. Call with strata()
coxph_model_strata <- dsBaseClient::ds.coxph.SLMA(formula = 'surv_object~D$age+survival::strata(D$female)')
summary(coxph_model_strata)

```

# Summary of survival objects

We can also summarize a server-side object of type *survival::Surv()*
using a call to *ds.summary()*. This will provide a non-disclosive
summary of the server-side object. An example call is shown below:


```

dsBaseClient::ds.summary(x = 'surv_object')

```



```{r, include=FALSE}

#################################
# summary of coxphSLMA
#################################
dsBaseClient::ds.summary(x = 'surv_object')
dsBaseClient::ds.class(x = 'surv_object')
dsBaseClient::ds.mean(x='surv_object')


#################################
# TODO: Plot survival curves
#################################
# fit <- survival::survfit(formula = 'surv_object~D$age+D$female', data = 'D')
# need ds.survfit() and survfitDS()

# plot(fit_model)

# In dsBaseClient::
# ds.survfit()
#         datashield.aggregate("survfitDS", ....)
#          return (the fit model)

# In dsBase::
# survfitDS(coxph_model)  
#               fit_model <- survival::survfit(coxph_model, newdata = 'D')
#               return (fit_model)

dsBaseClient::ds.survfit(formula='surv_object~1', objectname='survfit_object')
# verify that object has been created
dsBaseClient::ds.ls()

# ERROR summary of survfit not allowed
# dsBaseClient::ds.summary(x='survfit_object')
# dsBaseClient::ds.mean(x='survfit_object')

```


# Diagnostics for Cox proportional hazards models

We have also created functions to test for the assumptions of 
Cox proportional hazards models.

```
dsBaseClient::ds.coxphSLMAassign(formula = 'surv_object~D$age+D$female',
                            objectname = 'coxph_serverside')

dsBaseClient::ds.cox.zphSLMA(fit = 'coxph_serverside')

dsBaseClient::ds.coxphSummary(x = 'coxph_serverside')

```

A diagnostic summary is shown below. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}

dsBaseClient::ds.coxphSLMAassign(formula = 'surv_object~D$age+D$female', objectname = 'coxph_serverside')

dsBaseClient::ds.cox.zphSLMA(fit = 'coxph_serverside')

dsBaseClient::ds.coxphSummary(x = 'coxph_serverside')

```



# Meta-analyze hazard ratios

We now outline how the hazard ratios from the survival models are meta-analyzed. 
We use the *metafor* package for meta-analysis. We show the summary of an 
example meta-analysis and a forest plot below. The forest plot shows a basic
example of meta-analyzed hazard ratios from a survival model (analyzed in
DataSHIELD).

The log-hazard ratios and their standard erros from each study can be
found after running *ds.coxphSLMA()*

The hazard ratios can then be meta-analyzed:

```

metafor::rma(log_hazard_ratio, sei = se_hazard_ratio, method = 'REML')

```

A summary of this meta-analyzed model is shown below.


```{r, echo=FALSE}

# TODO: for each study
for (i_temp_counter in c(1:length(coxph_model_full)))
{
      
}

# list of hazard ratios for first parameter (age) over 3 studies 
input_logHR = c(coxph_model_full$study1$coefficients[1,2], coxph_model_full$study2$coefficients[1,2], coxph_model_full$study3$coefficients[1,2])
input_se    = c(coxph_model_full$study1$coefficients[1,3], coxph_model_full$study2$coefficients[1,3], coxph_model_full$study3$coefficients[1,3])

meta_model <- metafor::rma(input_logHR, sei = input_se, method = 'REML')
summary(meta_model)

#######################################################
# forest plots of final meta-analyzed hazard ratios
#######################################################
```

We now show a forest plot with the meta-analyzed hazard ratios. The hazard ratios come
from the DataSHIELD function *ds.coxphSLMA()*. The hazard ratios are meta-analyzed
using the *metafor* package.

```{r fig.cap="Example forest plot of meta-analyzed hazard ratios.", echo=FALSE}

metafor::forest.rma(x = meta_model)

```    

# Plotting of privacy-preserving survival curves

We also plot privacy preserving survival curves.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
dsBaseClient::ds.plotsurvfit(formula = 'survfit_object')
```

# Dealing with preserving privacy and disclosure checks

Disclosure checks are an integral part of DataSHIELD. We outline some of the checks we have built in to ensure privacy of individual level data. We also outline some issues that need to be discussed.   


## Disclosure related to oversaturated models

We disallow any Cox models where the number of parameters are greater than a fraction (set to 0.2) of the number of data points. The number of data points is the number of entries (for all patients) in the survival data.

## Summary of Cox models with no individual data

We also present privacy preserving summaries of Cox models and survival objects. These functions reveal no individual level data and present only quantiles.

## Dealing with strata() that could be potentially disclosive

An issue that needs further discussion is how to deal with strata in Cox models. It may be desirable to disallow Cox models with a strata that has less than a specified number of patients (for example 10).

## Relevant work for ensuring survival models are privacy preserving

We briefly outline some relevant work for ensuring survival models are privacy preserving. One work reduces the dimensions of a survival model and the reduced feature space model is then shared amongst multiple parties.

  * https://people.csail.mit.edu/romer/papers/PPCox_KDD08.pdf
  

# Development plan for additional functions

We now outline additional functionalities that can be implemented. We envisage rolling these out in phased releases.



## Plotting diagnostics for Cox proportional hazards models
  
  * residuals like Schoenfeld residuals plotted over time to test for 
  validity of assumptions in the Cox proportional hazards model
  
  * equivalent of functions like survival::cox.zph()
  
    * dsBaseClient::ds.plot.cox.zphSLMA()
    
    * dsBase::plot.cox.zphDS()
        


## Plotting survival curves that are non-disclosive

The functions planned are:

  * dsBaseClient::ds.survfit()
  
  * dsBase::survfitDS()
  
  * dsBaseClient::ds.plotsurvival()
  
  * dsBaseClient::ds.plotsurvival(survfit_object, fun="cloglog")
  
  * dsBase::plotsurvivalDS()
  
  * use of ggplot() within these functions
  

## Additional options in coxph()

  * additional options in coxph() like control, subset
 

## Time dependent covariates in Cox proportional hazards models

  * facility for inline functions in call to coxph.SLMA()
  
  ```
  
  coxph( Surv(time, status) ~ age + sex + tt(ph.karno),
         data = lung,
         tt   = function(x,t,...) x * log(t+20)
       )
      
  
  ```
  
  * other niche examples for time dependent covariates in survival models
  
  
    * some examples are given in the following paper:
    
    
    https:www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6015946
    
    
    * equivalent of survival::survSplit() as another approach for time dependent covariates  



# Graphical user interface for survival analysis

We will create a graphical user interface for survival models based on R shiny. The interface will allow the following:

  * changing covariates from a dropdown (applied to the meat analysis)
  
  * changing thresholds like energy intake from a dropdown
  
  * generation of meta-analyzed hazard ratio forest plots
  
  * plotting privacy preserving survival curves

  * showing diagnostics like testing assumptions of Cox proportional hazards models
  
  * screenshots of GUI
  

# Other ideas

  * privacy preserving plotting
  
  * saving state on GUI and reproducible research using rmarkdown notebooks (similar to radiant user interface)
  
  * privacy preserving summary using quantile means
  
  * technical definition of privacy and disclosure checks for plotting of survival models
  
      * for example, how does the ordering of events violate privacy? 
      
      * is it disclosive only if combined with other covariates (stratified by age, gender, etc.)?
